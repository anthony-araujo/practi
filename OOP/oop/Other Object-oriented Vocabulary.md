Cohesion describes how closely related the code is in a particular module. 
In this sense, the word module can refer to any grouping of code.

Cohesion refers to how well the elements at that level are focused on the single concept.



## Coupling

Classes that leverage other classes become logically coupled to them.

Tightly coupled code is more brittle, loosely coupled code is more flexible
