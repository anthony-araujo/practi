# Pillar and Principles
# The four pillars

## Abstraction: 
Implementation Hiding

You don't need to know how other classes work internally, it's none of your buiness

## Encapsulation
Data Hiding

You don't need to know what other classes know, if they want your help they'll ask for it. This is sometimes called data hiding.

## Inheritance
Object Taxonomy

Objects have a taxonony, a familly tree if you will

## Polimorphism
Object Interchangeability

A method that takes an animal will gladly accept a dog or a lizard.
