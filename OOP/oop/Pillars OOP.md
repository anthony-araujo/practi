# Pillar and Principles
# The four pillars

## Abstraction: 
Implementation Hiding

You don't need to know how other classes work internally, it's none of your buiness
Abstracting away implementation detail also gives you the opportunity to make changes
to that implementation if a better solution is found in the future.

### Interface (C# Keyword)
Defines members that must be present on any non-abstract class that implements the interface.
The externally visible members of a module.



## Encapsulation
Data Hiding

You don't need to know what other classes know, if they want your help they'll ask for it. This is sometimes called data hiding.

## Inheritance
Object Taxonomy

Objects have a taxonony, a familly tree if you will

## Polimorphism
Object Interchangeability

A method that takes an animal will gladly accept a dog or a lizard.
